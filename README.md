1) I have executed the task on my laptop with a resolution of 1920 * 1080 with Chrome. The project is under the /fe-task directory.
2) The design isn't responsive for 'longer than wide' screens such as phones / tablets.
3) The entire layout is created using flexbox while avoiding giving absolute pixel values and dealing in relative values and percentages.
4) Font Size remains fixed even when window size is changed, however this and other layout issues can be handled using media queries for different screen sizes.
5) I've added a small delete icon for each widget and handled the adoptive design expectation.
6) I've used the font provided, i.e, Rota, everywhere for consistency.

Please find attached a screenshot of the app on my native desktop, I believe it should turn out same on your end too.
